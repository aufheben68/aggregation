# Aggregation
A python script that uses numpy and matplotlib to simulate particle aggregation into random fractals.

I use the box cover algorithm to create the aggregate fractal and finally I produce a line on a logarthmic scale.

Here you can see a generated fractal:

And it's corresponding logarithmic line:
